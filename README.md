## Final Project

Last summer a little girl drowned in a few inches of water. A lot of people were around her and none noticed that.

Drowning is one of the top 5 causes of death for people aged 1–14. Western Pacific Region children aged 5–14 years die more frequently from drowning than any other cause.

Thinking about all this makes you shiver, a so horrible death due to distraction of parents.

During holidays also parents are relaxing, children are so energetic and full of fun and they move away, without being controlled.

We propose a simple device, for the children, that is able to advise parents when a dangerous situation in water is happening, monitoring vital parameters with PPG.

Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a technology widely used in developing small and wearable sensors for pulse rate detection. It is composed by a diode (LED) and a photodetector (PD) able to detect changes in light absorption. When heart pumps blood through the body, we are able to detect a change in volume by measuring the amount of light reflected back to the photodetector after the skin is illuminated by the LED. The delay between the emission and detection of the light is used to recreate the pulse signal\cite{b4}.

The device presented in this report is named SafeCub and it is developed to collect data regarding heart rate and oxygen level and then display them in a user Interface. If the device detects that vital parameters are far from normal values, an alarm in the interface is set to warn the parents that their child is in danger.
